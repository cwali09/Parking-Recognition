# Parking-Recognition

Parking Recognition Project for COSC 4324 Entrepreneurship for CS; Fall 2018


Packed Parking Garages frequently have issues with people taking up excess space when there are a limited number of spots. 
To mitigate this issue, we have built an MVP for a notification system which alerts Parking Garage management 
when there is a car that isn't parked correctly. Management can then take issue into their own hands enact a 
penalty on the owner of the car with this data.


How it works:

The program is trained with Machine learning algorithms with Tensorflow, and should output the following to the console:

0 - If a car is parked incorrectly;
1 - The car is parked correctly;
2 - There is no car parked in the spot;

With the LED lights installed on the Raspi, it should shine red when a car is parked incorrectly and send an email to the parking administration to alert them.
